# Gatsby Bulma Quickstart

## ⚠️ Currently not actively maintained

Hey! I created this project when I was dipping my toes into the world of web development. A lot has happened since then. Currently, this project is not actively maintained so I am going to archive it. Feel free to fork or take over it if you still want to maintain it. Although, I think the web dev world has come a long way since then especially for personal blogs and portfolio sites. ✌️
